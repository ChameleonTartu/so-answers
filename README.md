# so-answers

This repo collects some of my answers on StackOverflow that required writing/fixing code snippets or small proptotypes as a proof of concepts for the questions.

## How can this help you?

You can post your code questions as issues with links to StackOverflow. I will try answering all of them to best of my ability.

I am professional in Kotlin, Java and Python. Also, use JS, Terraform and clouds.

## Can I suppot you?

Feel free to buy me a coffee or leave feedback on my work.

## Why would I even bother to go here?

I saw many times as developers got unfairly downvoted on okay questions while many terrible questions are on the platform.

I do think that there are no bad questions as long as you aren't abusing QA system. Please, don't post "I don't want to think. Do it for me!" type of questions.
